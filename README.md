# Motion-Detection



üìå Project Overview

This project is a computer vision application that detects motion and tracks moving objects (primarily people) in video streams using OpenCV. It compares consecutive frames to identify moving regions and highlights them with bounding boxes.
‚ú® Key Features

    Real-time motion detection in video streams

    Background subtraction using frame differencing

    Noise reduction with Gaussian blur
